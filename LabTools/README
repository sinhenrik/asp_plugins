This plugin allows to increase or decrease the image contrast and lightness by applying an S-shape curve to the Lab L channel.
It also allows to increase or decrease the saturation level by modifying the slope of the Lab a and b channels.

The plugin effect is controlled using three parameters:
- Contrast: increase or decrease the image contrast
- Lightness: increase or decrease the image lightness
- Saturation: increase or decrease the image saturation

Note that, due to the nonlinear transformation used, the lightness effect depends on the contrast level value.

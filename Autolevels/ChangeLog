0.3
- added code to register the "group name" in the registry (Andrew Johnston)

0.2
- Fixed the group name
- Changed the way the histogram transformation is computed. Apparently, the histogram displayed in ASP is computed
  in SRGB space. So I changed the computations to make the computed histogram match the displayed histogram. An then,
  the histogram transformation is computed from there.

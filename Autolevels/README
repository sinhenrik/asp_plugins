AutoLevels 0.3

This simple plugin implements the auto levels function.
The image histogram is stretched so that a percentage (Black control) of the image is pure black and a percentage
(White control) of the image is pure white.
This is the same function as the builtin AutoLevel, but placed later in the filter stack.

Mac OS X
